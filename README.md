## Overview  
Iris Tumor Detection is a machine learning project designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing tumors in the iris region. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model processes input images of the eye and classifies whether a tumor is present or not.  

This project aims to:  
- Enhance early tumor detection for better treatment outcomes.  
- Reduce manual effort and improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Features  
- **Automated Detection**: Classifies eye images into tumor or no-tumor categories.  
- **Efficient Preprocessing**: Handles image noise and variability.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Can be extended for use in real-world clinical systems.
